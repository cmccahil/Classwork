2. frequency.c prints the frequencies of a letter in a text file.
   encode_bits.c prints out the binary version of a text file.
   decode_bits2.c decodes the binary text file and turns it into characters
   bits.c contains the functions necessary for the previous 2 functions 
   getnum.c reads a binary, hexadecimal, octadecimal, or decimal number and returns a long
   tobinary.c turns whatever version of number there is in a file into binary numbers
   tohexadecimal.c does this into hexadecimal
   todecimal.c does this into decimal
   tooctal.c does this into octadecimal
   
3. Someone should use my getnum by using one of the "to" functions and giving it an input.
   example: ./todecimal < textfile.txt. It signals the validity when it prints the numbers. 
   If it is not valid it will print an error message. 

4. my makefile refuses to compile decode_bits2.c it is almost there but not quite. Please when grading explain why it does not want to compile decode_bits2.c. As a result of this I will also include decode_bits which is my original file I created that works (except it does not terminate)

6. This program took me about 25 hours to complete this lab. I spent about 18 or 19 of it on getnum and I got stuck at the end trying to fix decode_bits2.c before I ran out of time. Please use one of my late days.
