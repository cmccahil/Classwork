2. encode.c encodes lines of texts into a Huffman tree, encodes the paths to each leaf. 
decode.c takes an encode file and returns it back to the text version. 

3. Bugs: 

-Haven't yet figured out how to free all of the memory on encode.c. When I deleted a Node when making the Huffman tree, I tried to store the deleted node in a temporary value and then free the memory but Valgrind would give me hundreds of errors when I did this and segmentation defaults. 


Please provide insight on how to fix this. 

5. Spent about 20-25 hours on this assignment.
