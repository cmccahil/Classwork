Sam Chapin and Colin McCahill  worked together on this lab (lab 3).

Questions:
1. Sam Chapin and Colin McCahill
2. Our MySolverQueue crashes due to stackoverflow on the bigger mazes because our Queue class uses ArrayLists, which creates inefficiencies.
3. Our MazeStackSolver is n^2 for Big-O we figured this out because the least efficient part of our code is our nested for loops.
4. Stack is much superior to Queue because Stack does not require recreating an 2 ArrayLists withing a nested for loop everytime a pop() is called.  Stack, therefore, does not create stackoverflows, while Queue does.
5. We do not know. we just search for a dead-end, so maybe a dead-end algorithm.


We affirm that we have adhered to the Honor Code on this assignment.
