last number in the first test is 134,210,000. 81.304seconds
last number in the second test is 18,170,000. It did not terminate(ran it for about a half hour and then gave up)

Both tests slowed down as they neared the end of their memory. The one with more memory took considerably longer(using more memory obviously made it take longer).

I would like to use my first late lab freebie in this assignment.
