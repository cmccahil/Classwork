README Questions:
1. Colin McCahill, Shomya Mitra
2. This assignment was helpful because it was useful to see what an actual report should look like, and 
it was useful to practice writing one. The coding wasn't too difficult, of course it took a little time
to figure out how to prepare the data, feed it into the algorithm, and parse the results into csv. The 
longest and tedious and most annoying part was going through and calculating the accuracies, recalls, and 
confidence intervals, I definetly should have written a program that did this for me. 
3. We spent around 10 hours on this assignment.
4. We affirm that we have adhered to the honor code in this assignment
