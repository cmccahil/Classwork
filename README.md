Machine Learning Located in "Machine Learning". The Twitter Bot Project is project with the largest effort, using Neural Networks and Decision Trees to identify Twitter Bots based on account information. The project also uses Naive Bayes Natural Language Processing to identify twitter bots based on the tweets of accounts. 

Artificial Intelligence Work Located in "Intro to AI". I was able to retain only one lab exploring search algorithms. The lab explores Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, IDS, Greedy Algorithm, A*, and Hill Climbing Algorithm

Distributed Systems Work Located in "Distributed Systems/Assignment 3" In this assignment we implemented a block class, a blockchain class, and a transaction class to pass transactions through the blockchain. 

Systems Programming Work Located in "cs241". In our final project we broke down sound files of songs, and used an algorithm to detect the BPM of each song.

Data Stuctures Work Located in "cs151"
